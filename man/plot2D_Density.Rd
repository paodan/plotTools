\usage{
plot2D_Density(
  data,
  x,
  y,
  maxN = 10000,
  bins = 100,
  point_size = 0.5,
  low = "white",
  high = "red",
  title = "Density of points"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing the variables to be plotted.}

\item{x}{A string giving the name of the column in data to be used as the x-axis.}

\item{y}{A string giving the name of the column in data to be used as the y-axis.}

\item{maxN}{Integer (default = 10000). If the dataset has more than maxN rows,
a random subset of rows of size maxN is sampled for plotting. Set to NULL
to plot all rows.}

\item{bins}{Integer (default = 100). The resolution (number of grid points per axis)
used for kernel density estimation.}

\item{point_size}{Numeric (default = 0.5). Size of points in the scatter plot.}

\item{low}{Color for low density values (default = "white").}

\item{high}{Color for high density values (default = "red").}

\item{title}{Character string giving the plot title (default = "Density of points").}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing the points colored by their density.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the density of points in a 2D space using kernel density estimation
and colors the scatter plot by local density. It is useful for visualizing large datasets
where overplotting makes it difficult to see point distributions.
}
\details{
The function estimates the local density of points in the 2D plane using MASS::kde2d,
then interpolates these densities to the observed point coordinates with
fields::interp.surface. The densities are mapped to the color scale in ggplot2.
If a column named "density" already exists in data, it is used directly instead
of being recalculated (a warning will be issued).
